Creating a user-level threading library is a exciting project. Below, I provide a C++ implementation of a user-level threading library with the following features:

Features:
Thread Creation: Allows users to create threads with a function and arguments.
Round-Robin Scheduling: Implements basic scheduling using a queue.
Synchronization:
Mutexes for mutual exclusion.
Condition variables for thread communication.
Thread Termination: Handles proper thread cleanup.
We'll use C++ and POSIX APIs, particularly setjmp/longjmp to manage thread contexts, and ucontext.h for context switching.
